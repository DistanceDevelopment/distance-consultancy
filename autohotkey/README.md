Distance for Windows AutoHotkey Scripts
=======================================

[AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com) is an open source scripting tool for automating Windows 
applications. For an introduction see the AutoHotkey [tutorial](http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm).

The scripts in this directory were executed using AutoHotkey 1.1.16.05 (September 28 2014) available from the [download](http://ahkscript.org/download/) page.

To run:

* Check the paths in [Config.ahk](./Config.ahk) are valid for your local Distance installation.
* If running against a development version of Distance.exe built from Distance.vbp, run Distance.exe manually for the first time and accept the warning dialog box. Subsequent invocations will not show this warning.
* The scripts assume that the tip of the day is displayed when Distance is started.
