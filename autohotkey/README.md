Distance for Windows AutoHotkey Scripts
=======================================

[AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com) is an open source scripting tool for automating Windows 
applications. For an introduction see the AutoHotkey [tutorial](http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm).

The scripts in this directory were executed using AutoHotkey 1.1.16.05.

To run:

* Check the path in the script points to your Distance.exe.
* Check other paths are valid for your local environment.
* If testing Distance.exe built directly by Distance.vbp open it up manually for the first time and 
  accept the warning dialog box. Subsequent invocations will not show this warning dialog box.
