Developer Experience Review
===========================

Based on []() by Mike Jackson, The Software Sustainability Institute / EPCC, The University of Edinburgh


Refactor developer information form, content and hosting
========================================================

 - [ ] Use wikis or revision control
 - [ ] Host documentation alongside its related products
 - [ ] Review and update documentation

Folder, file and database formats
=================================

 - [ ] Mention `.dst` file format in user's guide

Interfaces between Distance for Windows, FORTRAN and R
======================================================


 - [ ] Pull out Appendix - MCDS Engine Reference into a stand-alone user guide
 - [ ] Update reference on how to run MCDS from another program
 - [ ] Provide standalone R and MCDS examples


API documentation
=================

 - [ ] Auto-generate API documentation
 - [ ] Provide API documentation as HTML


Dependencies on third-party software
====================================

 - [ ] List origins of tools and external components
 - [ ] Provide external dependencies as a table


Source code and documentation management
========================================


 - [ ] Put all manually-created artefacts under revision control
 - [ ] Move MCDS code to GitHub
 - [ ] Fix link to `mrds` repository
 - [ ] Clarify whether SourceForge hosts the canonical FORTRAN code
 - [ ] Add an MCDS README


Coding standards
================

 - [ ] Coding standards for the three languages used within Distance are as follows.

 - [ ] Provide information on how to write and run VB tests
 - [ ] Implement MCDS tests
 - [ ] Provide information on how to write and run MCDS tests
 - [ ] Generalise testthat advice
 - [ ] Update link to testthat


Release processes
=================

 - [ ] Document release processes

Setting up a development environment
====================================

 - [ ] Provide a "clean" virtual machine


Additional documentation recommendations
========================================

 - [ ] Put Required knowledge in its own section
 - [ ] Add GIS to required knowledge
 - [ ] Add packrat, testthat and RStudio to tools
 - [ ] Update link to Rtools
 - [ ] Pull out Appendix - Inside Distance into a stand-alone document
 - [ ] Combine internal components list and table
 - [ ] Separate external components into types
 - [ ] Remove incomplete or unwritten doc
 - [ ] Add missing image to user's guide
 - [ ] Add link from DistanceDevelopment `README.md`
