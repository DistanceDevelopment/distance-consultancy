Project Governance
==================

The [Distance project](http://distancesampling.org) provides software, Distance, for the design and analysis of distance sampling surveys of wildlife populations. Distance is used by biologists, students, and decision makers to better understand animal populations without the need for these users to have degrees in statistics or computer science. 

This report discusses issues around the governance of the Distance project. This includes copyright, licencing, support, contributions, issue and bug management etc.

Please contact the author at m.jackson@software.ac.uk if you have any queries.

Review status
-------------

This report, started 08/09/14, is currently work-in-progress and is a mix of notes, recommendations, and questions. The current content has arisen as a result of a

* [Web site review](./WebSiteReview.md)
* [User experience review](./UserExperienceReview.md)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Copyright and licence
=====================

[Distance for Windows](http://distancesampling.org/Distance/index.html) states that:

> Distance 6.2 as well as previous versions (6.1, 5.0, 4.1, 3.5 and 2.2) are available for download below at no cost. Suggested citations for all three versions are given on the citation page.

[Citing Distance](http://distancesampling.org/citation.html) provides the recommended citation for Distance:

> Thomas, L., S.T. Buckland, E.A. Rexstad, J. L. Laake, S. Strindberg, S. L. Hedley, J. R.B. Bishop, T. A. Marques, and K. P. Burnham. 2010. Distance software: design and analysis of distance sampling surveys for estimating population size.  Journal of Applied Ecology 47: 5-14. DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01737.x

It also suggests that users: 

> be explicit about the version and release number of Distance you used, since results may vary between versions.  For example, you might write in a methods section: 'Analyses were carried out using Distance 6.0 release 2 (Thomas et al. 2010)' where the citation lists the above paper.

This is good practice and contributes to reproducible research.

Move the citation request to release-specific download pages
------------------------------------------------------------

This would mean that a user sees the request before they download Distance and may prompt them to cite Distance.

Make the citation request a requirement
---------------------------------------

Consider making the citation request a requirement, by adding it to the Use Agreement. This is becoming more popular amongst research software developers, to help demonstrate impact. For example:

> Any results that you produce using Distance and which you publish
> - including posters, papers, presentations or book chapters - in
> paper or electronic form, must cite:
>
> ... 

Clarify licensing of Distance extras
------------------------------------

[Distance Extras](http://distancesampling.org/distanceextras.html) provides links to Distance-related tools and downloads. The licensing of these is unclear from the page.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Communication
=============

The project's [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/distance-sampling):

* Allows anonymous browsing.
* Allows posting once a user has a free Google ID.
* Has regular traffic, at least 1-2 posts a month.

This provides evidence that the project both open is active.

The project's [Bugzilla](http://www.ruwpa.st-and.ac.uk/distance/bugzilla/):

* Allows anonymous browsing.
* Allows posting once a user has a free Bugzilla account.
* Does not seem to have regular activity (see below).

Ensure more than one team member can access distance@mcs.st-and.ac.uk
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Requests for users to contact Distance team members via their personal e-mail addresses should be avoided, just in case they are on leave, or they leave. 

Any e-mails from users should go to the project e-mail account, and more than one team member should have access to this. This ensures that e-mails are replied to in a timely manner. A user can be deterred from using software further, or a potential user might look elsewhere, if they get no reply to an e-mail. In the worst case this can lead to bad word-of-mouth to others. 

What is the process for the use of Bugzilla?
--------------------------------------------

On 09/09/14, Bugzilla had 113 open bugs, opened between 09/2010 to 05/2014. There were 5 closed bugs. A number of the bugs raised have stagnated e.g.

* [118](http://www.ruwpa.st-and.ac.uk/distance/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=118). Opened 2014-05-06, a Distance team member responded, and the user replied on 2014-05-08, since then there has been no action.
* [116](http://www.ruwpa.st-and.ac.uk/distance/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=116). Opened 2014-03-17, no response from the Distance team.

Being unresponsive may lead users to conclude that the project is dead, or a product is not being maintained. In the worst case this can lead to bad word-of-mouth to others.

How are Known Problems managed?
-------------------------------

[Current restrictions, known problems and workarounds Distance 6.0 Release 2](http://distancesampling.org/Distance/old-versions/d60knownproblems.html) lists various known problems e.g.

> 247 General -  Details windows.  On systems with extended character sets (e.g., Chinese, Japanese and Korean Language systems), the results of running analyses, surveys, etc. are not displayed.  This occurs because ... Workaround: ... [LJT 28 Nov 2003]

These are also listed in the [Distance 6.2 Release 1 Release Notes - 22 April 2014](http://distancesampling.org/Distance/old-versions/downloads/ReadMeD62.rtf)

There is no Bugzilla entry with this number.

Questions:

* Where and how are the Known Problems recorded?
  *     I believe these are stored in the RTF document itself
* What is the process for recording them?
  *     I don't know
* What is the process for resolving them?
  *     I don't know

See also 'Define a support policy and process' below.

Define a support policy and process
-----------------------------------

The project releases a number of products:

* [Distance for Windows](http://distancesampling.org/Distance/index.html): Distance releases past and present.
* [Distance R packages](http://distancesampling.org/R/index.html): R packages, via CRAN and in-development versions on GitHub.
* [Distance Extras](http://distancesampling.org/distanceextras.html): Distance-related tools.

[Contact us](http://distancesampling.org/contact.html) states that:

> Please remember that Distance is free, so techical support is given on a 'best effort' basis (i.e., we'll do the best we can, given our other commitments).

Questions:

* Are older Distance versions supported?
  *  No, we recommend people update 
* Are the R packages supported?
  *  Yes, via Googlegroup 
* Are in-development versions cloned from GitHub supported?
  *  Not really
* Are the extras supported?
  *  No 

As there have been issues with users being reluctant to use Bugzilla, users can be told to submit all feature requests and bug reports go via GoogleGroup. For these, a team member can then raise a ticket. 

You can never 100% stop users e-mailing invididual members of the team. However, any users that contact individual team members can politely be requested to resubmit their request to the GoogleGroup. Such requests can emphasise that others may be interested in the request (or may be stuck with the same bug) and may be interested in the answer. If a user really wants/needs help they will do this. Or, for a first-timer, you can send their e-mail and your reply to the GoogleGroup yourself. If they reply to you personally, remember to CC the GoogleGroup in your reply.

For a project I worked on for many years, OGSA-DAI, we found that this approach was the least painful.

It is worth defining a support process and policy. This can define:

* Level of support e.g. 'best effort', above.
* When users can expect a response e.g. 'we aim to reply to all e-mails within 1 week'. 
 * Responding to an e-mail or new Bugzilla or GitHub ticket ensures the user does not feel ignored, which can be an issue as mentioned previously. 
 * Responding to a user request does not imply fixing a bug or implementing a feature, it merely acknowledges that you've heard them. No-one has a right to *expect* support for free software.
* How users should report bugs or request features. A web page summarising this is proposed in the [Web site review](./WebSiteReview.md).

Impact
======

Usage statistics
----------------

Both the [Distance](http://distancesampling.org/) web site front page and [Who Uses Distance?](http://distancesampling.org/Distance/distanceusers.html) describe usage statistics and that a database of downloaders is kept. The release-specific Download forms (GoogleForms) record:

* Name
* E-mail
* Country
* Study taxa: Birds, Terrestrial mammals, Marine mammals, Reptiles/amphibians, Fish, Insects, Plants, Other (user-specified)

[Who Uses Distance?](http://distancesampling.org/Distance/distanceusers.html) describes the approach to gathering usage statistics. The statistics are derived from unique e-mails registered during download with the comment that:

> the number of unique emails registered during download is likely an overestimate of the true number of people using the program.  This is because: (1) some people will have changed email address, and then re-registered to download a new version under their new address; (2) some people will have downloaded the program but never seriously used it.  On the other hand, we known that some institutions have downloaded the program only once, and then loaded it onto a network of machines for use in teaching, etc.

These are augmented by the number of e-mail list users, with the comment that:

> A separate measure of the number of 'serious' users of Distance is those on the distance-sampling email list.  These people are prepared to receive several emails a week on the topic of distance sampling, so can be taken to be somewhat committed to the subject. Not all members of the list are necessarily Distance users, but we expect that most are.

Questions:

* How is the data stored?
  *  Old data (pre-new website) is stored on `\\SHELOB\www\htmlruwpa\distance\log` a network share/webserver at CREEM. New data is stored in a Google Spreadsheet.
* Where is the data held?
  *  See above.
* Who has access? More than one team member? 
  *  Thomas, Miller, Rexstad
* Is the analysis process documented? 
  *  Partially; see `Y:\Workshops\Distance\DistanceDownloads\getdownloadsfromemail.r`
* Is it automated?
  *  No 

Consider cross-referencing e-mails from downloaders with e-mails to the forum e.g. a serious user could be a downloader who has submitted N+ e-mails to the forum.

Mutual promotion
----------------

[Other software](http://distancesampling.org/othersoftware.html) lists software that uses Distance components e.g. MGET and WebSim.

You may want to approach these groups and ask whether some form of mutual promotion can be done. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Various
=======

Is there a policy for backwards compatibility?
----------------------------------------------

Any changes to directory structures, naming conventions or project files could cause problems for existing users who wish to upgrade their version. Likewise, changes to function names, arguments or return types in R packages could also cause upgrade problems for developers using these.

Such changes should be considered carefully and users warned if such changes are implemented, before they upgrade. A policy or process for deciding upon and implementing such changes, and notifying users, should be created and published on a project resource e.g. a wiki or the web site.

Is compatibility of Distance extras with Distance releases tested?
------------------------------------------------------------------

[Distance Extras](http://distancesampling.org/distanceextras.html) provides links to Distance-related tools and downloads. Are these tested for compatibility with new Distance releases as they appear?

Bibliography
------------

[Distance Sampling References](http://distancesampling.org/dbib.html) on the web site and [Distance Sampling References](http://www.ruwpa.st-and.ac.uk/distancesamplingreferences/) accessed via the St. Andrews CREEM training pages both list searchable bibliographies. The pages have the same look and feel apart from colour scheme. However, the former lists 1274 references and the latter 1277.

Questions:

* How is the data stored?
  * Bibtex file using JabRef
* Where is the data held?
  *  C:\Users\eric\Dropbox\onlinebib  Dave, you can discuss this
* Who has access? More than one team member? 
  *   Marques, Miller, Rexstad
* Why is there a discrepency in the counts?
  *  notsure what is happening with reference numbers of the two files `dbib.html` and `ruwpa` address

It may be worth having one definitive version of the data, or just deprecating the latter page with the former.
